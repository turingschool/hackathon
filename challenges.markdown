## Education
* High school students are often required to volunteer.  There's a big need for 
elementary school tutors/mentors for students of low income background.  Build an
app that connects high school students who are interested with an elementary school
teacher who would be willing to host one-on-one or small group tutoring sessions
in their classroom after school.
* Create a bully reporting app that sends school administrators information on where
the bullying is occurring so that they can be more present in problem areas.  Allow
the person reporting to either be anonymous or provide a name.
* Create a social flash card app where people can share ones they've already created.
Create an algorithm that only repeats the flashcards when needed.
* Children with behavioral issues often struggle in school and at home in developing
positive ways of interacting in difficult situations.  Similarly, parents often lack
the skills to properly guide children who are struggling.  One way of subtly altering
these ingrained behaviors would be to create a choose your own adventure application
that allows children to choose how they react in difficult situations, learning the consequences
of unproductive behaviors and the benefits of good ones.
* Create a chat application with channels specific to groups of people that are having
similar issues to facilitate building a support network.
* Many children rarely go outside.  Build an application that promotes getting outside
through an interactive scavenger hunt.  
* In the same vein, build an application that allows you to view and filter Denver area parks
and recreational areas by activities and amenities.

## Unemployment

* There's evidence that availability of summer jobs have a direct influence on
reducing crime. What about a specialized job board where local businesses could
post one or more jobs, then students could browse and even apply for them?
* There are dozens of huge job sites out there, but it's hard to keep track of
your search across them. What about a single site where you could use something
like a bookmarklet to create an aggregate listing of all the ads you're interested
in?
* For some kinds of jobs there are dozens or hundreds of listings to sift through.
What about an app that could pull listings matching a certain search criteria, then
use bayesian filtering to build up a profile of what I'm looking for and highlight
the jobs most likely to be interesting to me.
* For many workers, particularly those who don't speak English well, 
not being paid or not being paid in full by employers is a persistent problem. Think
about an application or tool that workers could use to somehow track their hours
on the job, store a timestamped photo of paychecks received, or otherwise consider
how workers could use a third-party record of payment information so they can more
easily collect their wages.
* With the internet, it can be easy to send your resume to hundreds of companies that
are hiring.  However, spending the time honing your interviewing skills and improving
your resume might improve your chances of getting hired.  Since we're often our biggest
critics, build a website where you can record yourself doing a mock interview and play it
back.  For additional functionality, add the ability for someone to pair with you either
for a traditional or technical interview.



## Housing / Homelessness

* Homeless shelters fill up. It would be great if a person with only access to
SMS were able to find out which shelters currently have a bed available.
* Denver is experiencing record low availability for property rental or purchase
and competition is fierce. It would be great if there were a site where you could
signup, specify what you're looking for, and get a text or email when a new matching
listing shows up on Craigslist.
* Housing is more accessible with roommates, but it's hard to find roommates unless
a group has an existing place and an open room. How about a way to find roommates
who share similar requirements but don't yet have a place. You could create a
profile with what your requirements are, then get matched up with other users
who fit.
* Homeless individuals need many of the same documents others need: health, legal, 
financial, educational, personal ID documents, and other types of records. 
Think about ways the homeless population could have a digital storage place for information 
that they can use to apply for jobs, access needed services from organizations or government 
agencies with, or use to receive proper medical care even when they're moving around very
often. Think of it like a digital backpack for all the information or things a person needs 
on a regular basis.


## Accessibility to Services
*Legal aid organizations and volunteers need help managing the influx of those who need their
help. Their time needs to be maximized. Design a human-centered system that an organization
could simply access for easily scheduling an appointment with specific members of 
legal aid staff that would also send an email or text message remind to both parties beforehand. 
Think about how this could be used throughout the entire legal process--used first for 
scheduling and coordinating meetings, but later also perhaps for keeping track 
of court dates, when documents are due to the court or to legal aid staff, and 
generally helping both clients and volunteers with often stressful legal matters.
